# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves redesigning "The Road to Crypto" website to accommodate comprehensive BTC & XMR node setup information while maintaining the existing clean aesthetic and 3-language support. The current simple 3-phase layout needs to evolve into a robust information architecture that can elegantly present both the original crypto development roadmap and detailed technical node setup guides in a way that serves both beginners and advanced users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual Content Architecture

**User Story:** As a visitor to the crypto education website, I want to easily navigate between crypto development learning and node setup guides, so that I can access the specific type of information I need without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display clear navigation to both "Development Roadmap" and "Node Guides" sections
2. WHEN a user selects either main section THEN the system SHALL update the sidebar navigation to show the relevant subsections
3. WHEN a user is in one section THEN the system SHALL maintain visual clarity about which section they are currently viewing
4. WHEN a user switches between sections THEN the system SHALL preserve their language preference

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Node Setup Guide Integration

**User Story:** As someone wanting to set up BTC & XMR nodes, I want access to a detailed 4-phase guide with clear progression indicators, so that I can successfully complete the complex setup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Node Guides section THEN the system SHALL display the 4-phase structure (Procurement & Provisioning, Server Foundation & Security, Node Software Installation & Configuration, Blockchain Synchronization & Operation)
2. WHEN a user is following the node setup guide THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators indicating their current phase and overall completion
3. WHEN a user views a phase THEN the system SHALL break down complex information into digestible subsections with clear headings
4. WHEN a user encounters technical commands THEN the system SHALL display them in properly formatted code blocks with copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Requirement 3: Multi-Level Information Architecture

**User Story:** As a user with varying technical expertise, I want information presented in layers from overview to detailed implementation, so that I can access the appropriate level of detail for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any major section THEN the system SHALL provide a high-level overview before diving into detailed steps
2. WHEN a user encounters complex concepts THEN the system SHALL offer progressive disclosure through accordions or expandable sections
3. WHEN a user needs operating system specific instructions THEN the system SHALL present them in tabbed interfaces
4. WHEN a user wants quick access to commands THEN the system SHALL provide a "Quick Start" option alongside detailed explanations

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Multilingual Support

**User Story:** As a non-English speaker, I want consistent access to all content in my preferred language with proper technical term translations, so that I can follow complex technical guides effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL maintain that preference across all sections and pages
2. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL preserve their current location in the content structure
3. WHEN technical terms are used THEN the system SHALL provide consistent translations and optional glossary definitions
4. WHEN content structure varies between languages THEN the system SHALL maintain logical navigation flow in each language

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user learning complex technical processes, I want clear visual hierarchy, search functionality, and contextual help, so that I can efficiently find and understand the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page THEN the system SHALL display clear visual hierarchy with proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
2. WHEN a user needs to find specific information THEN the system SHALL provide site-wide search functionality
3. WHEN a user encounters technical jargon THEN the system SHALL offer tooltips or glossary links for definitions
4. WHEN a user views long content pages THEN the system SHALL provide a table of contents for quick navigation within the page
5. WHEN a user needs help with prerequisites THEN the system SHALL clearly state required knowledge, software, or hardware before each guide section

### Requirement 6: Visual Design and Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As a user accessing the site on various devices, I want a clean, professional design that works well on desktop and mobile while maintaining the existing aesthetic appeal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that adapts to screen size
2. WHEN a user views the site THEN the system SHALL maintain the current clean, professional aesthetic while accommodating more content
3. WHEN a user interacts with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback and intuitive behavior
4. WHEN a user views code blocks or technical content THEN the system SHALL ensure proper formatting and readability across devices

### Requirement 7: Content Organization and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user working through technical guides, I want persistent navigation, clear section organization, and the ability to easily jump between related topics, so that I can maintain context while accessing detailed information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is within a section THEN the system SHALL display a persistent sidebar with hierarchical navigation
2. WHEN a user completes a step or phase THEN the system SHALL provide clear next step guidance and navigation
3. WHEN a user needs to reference related information THEN the system SHALL provide contextual links to relevant sections
4. WHEN a user wants to understand the overall structure THEN the system SHALL provide landing pages that introduce each major section with clear navigation to subsections
